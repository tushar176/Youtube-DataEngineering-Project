# Youtube-DataEngineering-Project

## Overview
Developed an ETL pipeline using Python and AWS services (Glue,S3,Lambda,Athena) to process and analyze YouTube video data from Kaggle. Managed the extraction, cleaning, transformation, and loading of structured(CSV) and semi-structured data(JSON).

## Dataset Used
This Kaggle dataset contains statistics (CSV files) on daily popular YouTube videos over the course of many months. There are up to 200 trending videos published every day for many locations. The data for each region is in its own file. The video title, channel title, publication time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count are among the items included in the data. A category_id field, which differs by area, is also included in the JSON file linked to the region.
